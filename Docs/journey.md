test 1 faild just overlap images with simples method

we need something like dbrujin graph this algorithm is used to recontruct dna, we think we can use graph neural network for emulate something like debrujin graph


we need to do a small protype for this with odd number of images for test the algorithm

for the problem of memory overflow we going to use the pyvips
